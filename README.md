# StarGate
StarGate is a MongoDB Oplog (binary operation log) analyzer that can be modify to perform triggers base on any type of MongoDB event.  This application was originally engineered to generate REST calls (web-hook like operations) base on MongoDB write operations (IE: format and POST the insert from this collection to a remote REST service).
